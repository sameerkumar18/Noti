###What is Noti?  
Noti is your little companion living in your mac menu, relaying any notifications you get on your Android phone with [Pushbullet installed on it](https://pushbullet.com)!  
**Noti does one thing, and it does it really well: Notifications.**

##Download

###DMG
Get the [latest .dmg here](https://github.com/jariz/Noti/releases/latest).  

###brew cask
Or, simply use [homebrew cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/README.md) and install it with a single command :  
```
brew cask install noti
```
(homebrew must be updated, if not  ```brew update```)


##Features

###Dismissal sync
If you dismiss a notification from your mac, it will get dismissed from your device as well, and vice versa.
###Reply to messages, straight from a notification.  
![](https://jari.lol/vC6Mxphnrt.png)  
Whether it be a SMS, WhatsApp message, or Hangouts message, just enter your reply into the notification itself.

###Actions
![](https://jari.lol/ZTGXE6Zxk7.png)  
If a notification has any actions, you can execute those straight from the notification as well (_Pushbullet Pro required_)

##What it can't do as of yet

- Conversation interface (nice to have)
- File upload (nice to have)
